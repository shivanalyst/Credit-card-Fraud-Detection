Credit card fraud is one of the alarming issue being faced by the Banking, Finance and Insurance Sector. There is a pressing need to find a solution for the same. 

**INTRODUCTION**

Credit card fraud detection is the process of identifying purchase attempts that are fraudulent and rejecting them rather than processing the order.
